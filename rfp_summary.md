The "Liquidity Provisioning" project aims to build a user-facing application for DeepBook, enabling token holders to deploy capital to market-making strategies or operate custom strategies without writing code. The application should offer a range of predefined and configurable liquidity provisioning strategies, from simple to complex, with adjustable parameters like tick range, rebalancing frequency, and deposit limits. It must also provide performance tracking (P&L, drawdowns, DeepBook liquidity contributions) and risk management tools (timelocks, circuit breakers, drawdown limits, real-time monitoring).

The architecture should be vault-based, supporting major Sui assets (SUI, stablecoins, DEEP). The smart contract design needs to be modular, separating vault logic, strategy execution, risk controls, and user accounting for auditability and upgradeability.

Deliverables include open-source Move smart contracts, a web-based front end for strategy selection and monitoring, comprehensive technical documentation (architecture, usage, deployment guides), a full testing suite, and an audit-ready modular design. The project is open to applications, with a closing date for proposals.
