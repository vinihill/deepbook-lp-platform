# DeepBook Liquidity Provisioning Project Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed project plan for the development and deployment of a user-facing application for DeepBook liquidity provisioning on the Sui blockchain. This project is in response to the Request for Proposal (RFP) for "Liquidity Provisioning" and aims to deliver a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform that enables token holders to engage in market-making strategies on DeepBook without requiring coding expertise.

## 2. Project Goal

To develop and deploy a user-facing application for DeepBook liquidity provisioning on the Sui blockchain, including open-source Move smart contracts for strategy vaults, execution logic, and safety controls, a web-based front end for strategy selection, interaction, and performance monitoring, comprehensive technical documentation, and a full testing suite, all designed to be audit-ready and modular.

*   End-to-end test reports.
*   Security audit findings and remediation plan.

### Phase 5: Technical Documentation and Deployment Guides

**Goal:** To create comprehensive documentation for the project, covering architecture, usage, and deployment.

**Milestones:**
*   **M5.1:** Developed Detailed Architecture Documentation.
*   **M5.2:** Created User Usage Guides for the Web Application.
*   **M5.3:** Prepared Deployment Guides for Smart Contracts and Frontend.
*   **M5.4:** Documented API Specifications and Smart Contract Interfaces.

**Deliverables:**
*   `Architecture_Document.md`
*   `User_Guide.md`
*   `Deployment_Guide.md`
*   Updated `API_Specification.md`

### Phase 6: Final Review, Audit Preparation, and Deployment

**Goal:** To prepare the project for external audit and final deployment to the Sui mainnet.

**Milestones:**
*   **M6.1:** Conducted Final Internal Code Review and Quality Assurance.
*   **M6.2:** Prepared all Documentation and Code for External Audit.
*   **M6.3:** Addressed any Pre-Audit Findings.
*   **M6.4:** Deployed Smart Contracts to Sui Testnet/Devnet for Final Testing.
*   **M6.5:** Deployed Frontend Application to a Staging Environment.

**Deliverables:**
*   Audit-ready codebase and documentation package.
*   Deployed testnet smart contract addresses.
*   Staging environment URL for the frontend.

### Phase 7: Deliver Project to User

**Goal:** To formally deliver the completed project to the user, including all code, documentation, and deployed application access.

**Milestones:**

## 4. Resource Allocation

This project will primarily leverage Manus AI capabilities for research, analysis, documentation, and code generation, augmented by specialized tools for smart contract development (Move language), web frontend development (React/TypeScript), and testing frameworks. Human oversight will be crucial for strategic decisions, quality assurance, and final review.

## 5. Risk Management

Key risks include:

*   **Smart Contract Security:** Mitigated by modular design, rigorous testing, and external audits.
*   **Sui Network Changes:** Monitored through continuous research and adaptation of code.
*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Addressed through optimization and leveraging Sui's parallel execution.
*   **User Adoption:** Mitigated by intuitive UI/UX and comprehensive documentation.

## 6. Communication Plan

Regular updates will be provided at the completion of each major milestone or phase. Critical decisions requiring user input will be communicated promptly.
